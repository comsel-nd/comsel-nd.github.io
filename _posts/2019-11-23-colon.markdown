Molecular Simulations. Porous Materials. Machine Learning.

Research in the Colón group focuses on the study, discovery, and design of porous materials for targeted applications. We use and develop molecular modeling tools to: understand fluid behavior in porous confinement, quickly and accurately predict material properties and performance, and study the self-assembly pathways that give rise to promising materials. Current applications of interest include: water farming, humidity control, ion transport, and gas adsorption and separations.
